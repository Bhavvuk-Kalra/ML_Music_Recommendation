The Main goal of this project is to try multiple Basic Machine Learning (ML) Models for a music recommendation system for users.

The Datasets used for this study are - Members, Songs, Songs_extra_info, Members, Train, Test. The Column target in train and test datasets can have only 0 or 1 value denoting "Can recommend" and "Cannot Recoomend" to the User. Our task is to find if song and user pair (along with other detials from the datasets) can lead to target value 1 or 0.

Exploratory Data Anaylsis (EDA) is done on the datasets, Some Visualizations is further done on it and finally necessary Feature Engineering such as Merging, Sampling, Cleaning, Fixing multiple values in a column, Fixing Outliers is done on the data.
Then, multiple ML models are applied on this cleaned data and their performances are compared. The Final Performance Comparison is as follows -
